# [Human Talk 10/01/2018](https://www.meetup.com/HumanTalks-Paris/events/246478316/)

The meetup is organized every second tuesday of every month in a lot of big cities. This one was in Paris.
You can find the videos of the talks on the [youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKFAwlgWiAB4vUpgnS63qog/)

## 5 common misconception about [react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

* "That's not native, so it should have performance trade off, right?"
* "I don't think we can do [insert a feature here] with react-native"
* "It is a new tech, in one year, it will be abandoned and replaced by something else"
* "Can it be maintained on the long run ?"
* "Isn't it super hard to find people that actually can work with react-native ?"

The talker answered to these commonly shared misconceptions about react-native. If you never heard about react-native until
here, I would advise to watch the replay on the youtube channel (when available :smile:)

## E-Learning without internet

Bringing E-Learning courses to students in Ghana who do not have a cheap and stable internet connexion is not an easy task.
They started with a react native application as a POC. It unlocked some more budget so they decided to invest more on
the app. The talker presented how they build a [progressive web application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) 
that does not need to rely on internet to be used. That's not a new technology, but by combining some of existing features
in browser, we can create application that can work fully offline [(see for example)](https://www.pokedex.org/) 

A really interesting story. I hope to see more of theses application in the future... In suburb, internet connexion is
far from stable :worried: 

## Introduction to [atomic design](https://medium.com/@audreyhacq/l-atomic-design-une-m%C3%A9thode-de-co-creation-prometteuse-bd9d5fc2b2ad) :heart:

The talker, an UX designer, introduced atomic design. When you are designing a web page, you got through the following process :  
> user stories => wireframes => sketches => dev

The problem with that pipeline is that you design page by page. So you create a lot of code duplication between sketches 
and can easily loose consistency between pages. So [Airbnb proposed a solution to these problems](https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/) 
You can design by creating building blocks : which are called atoms. You combine them to create molecules and 
combine molecules to create pages.
In the end, a developer would be able to create a brand new page using those building block without harassing the UX designer.
[Airbnb also created an AI that can turn sketches into actual working application.](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/10/25/airbnb-ai-sketches-design-code/)

Personally, I think this technique would work greatly with [visual TDD](https://toucantoco.com/en/tech-blog/tech/visual-tdd)
and component architecture which is a really trendy approach.

## Microservices architectures

The talks tried to present microservices architectures in 10 minutes (format of the meetup)... After a short introduction about
microservices and how did the architecture popped back in 2014 with Martin Fowler.
It talked about :
* DDD
* Enterprise patterns
* CQRS
* Event sourcing
* Circuit breaker
* ...

Really, every listed subject needs a talk on it's own to be nicely explained, so for me, the talker should have aimed for 
a subset of the scope he tried to introduce...
